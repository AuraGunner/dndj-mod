Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Jokers

CURRENT VERSION - 0.2.1a

(Credit to eir_nya for the Killer Queen joker sprite)

This mod aims to re-imagine the various cards from the blackjack rougelite "Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers" as Jokers,
with extra features maybe coming soon.

### 0.2 UPDATE IS HERE!  TALISMAN IS REQUIRED FOR THIS MOD!!

8 NEW RANKS!

(0, 0.5, 1, Pi, 11, 12, 13, 21)
You can find these "Illegal" ranks in new uncommon Contraband Booster Packs, or by using the Black Magic spectral card

2 NEW SPECTRALS!

Inversion - Adds negative to 1 playing card

Black Magic - Destroys 1 random card and adds 3 Illegal cards

5 NEW JOKERS!

Musician [Rare] - Gains X0.2 Mult for every scored 21

Checkmate [Uncommon] - Reduces boss blind by 25%

Guillotine [Rare] - 0.5X Chips, 1.5X Hand size

Killer Queen [Uncommon] - Destroys 1 card and gains +5 mult at the start of each round

Stone Age Joker [Rare] - X3 Mult if played hand contains a Stone card

BALANCE CHANGES

- Jackpot changed from Uncommon to Rare
- Jackpot cost increased from 6 to 7
- Jackpot can no longer generate Negative playing cards
- Blueprint now works with Jackpot
- Jack in a Box now gains +3 Mult per round instead of per hand
